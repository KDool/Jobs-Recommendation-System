Are you also interested in e-commerce and like to take on new challenges? Help us drive Parcel Perform’s growth and join our team! We are looking for you!

WE NEED YOU ON OUR TEAM!

Our infrastructure team is responsible for the foundation on which other engineering teams build Parcel Perform’s suite of SaaS products. As a member of the team, you will:

You have the habit of thinking and communicating both qualitatively and quantitatively. You tend to make data-driven decisions and clearly articulate them. You value simple but well-documented solutions over clever but opaque systems.

YOUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
4+ years of hands-on experience with cloud-based infrastructures (AWS, GCP, or Azure) either at the position of DevOps, CloudOps, Reliability Engineer, Performance Engineer, System Engineer, or Backend Developer.
Good service-oriented mindset: the system is your product, and the developers are your customers.

Want to be on the deployment, automation, and maintenance for B2B software solutions in e-commerce logistics?

Parcel Perform is looking for an amazing team member to support us in Software engineering!

You have hands-on DevOps skills, 1-2 years of experience in back-end development might help, you’re technically savvy and have a good grasp on coding techniques? Are you also interested in e-commerce and like to take on new challenges? Help us drive Parcel Perform’s growth and join our team! We are looking for you!

WE NEED YOU ON OUR TEAM!

As a Member Of The Team, You Will

Our infrastructure team is responsible for the foundation on which other engineering teams build Parcel Perform’s suite of SaaS products.
Work with other engineering teams to design, build and operate cloud-based infrastructures that meet their needs.
Design and conduct reliability tests. Carry out capacity planning. Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize systems’ performance.
Manage production incidents, investigate, analyze root causes, resolve issues and build up prevention mechanisms.
Build internal tools and automation systems that improve engineering productivity, efficiency, and quality. For example efficient CI/CD pipelines, self-service observability tools, code quality checkers. Define workflows, conventions, best practices. Guide other engineers on how to use these tools effectively.
WHAT YOU SHOULD BRING ALONG!

You Would Be a Good Fit If The Followings Describe You

We at Parcel Perform believe in innovation, energy, and resourcefulness for everything we do. We will not stop delivering an outstanding product that we can be proud of and need you to help us to inform the world.
You are curious about how complex systems work. You are eager to open up abstraction levels lower than what a typical backend engineer is comfortable with.
You keep yourself up-to-date on technical trends. You are eager to explore new technologies but are careful in evaluating their merits and tradeoffs based on sound principles rather than hearsay.
You believe that good tooling and automation systems play a crucial role in an engineering-heavy organization. You like to identify drawbacks of existing, off-the-shelf tools, and to build custom solutions to rectify their deficiencies.
You have the habit of thinking and communicating both qualitatively and quantitatively. You tend to make data-driven decisions and clearly articulate them. You value simple but well-documented solutions over clever but opaque systems.
Your Skills And Experience
2+ years of hands-on experience with cloud-based infrastructures (AWS, GCP, or Azure) either at the position of DevOps, CloudOps, Reliability Engineer, Performance Engineer, System Engineer, or Backend Developer.
Good service-oriented mindset: the system is your product, and the developers are your customers.
Ability to evaluate tradeoffs involved with various cloud services.
Comfortability writing Bash/Python for ad-hoc automation tasks. Familiarity with infrastructure-as-code practices and tools.
Fluency with common Unix's administrative tools and administration tasks.
Good grasp of common network protocols: TCP/IP, TLS, HTTP, SSH... Basic understanding of Linux’s internals. For example process scheduling, memory management, IO mechanisms.
A clear understanding of different types of storage systems, and their respective trade-offs.
Good English communication.
WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IN RETURN!

We at Parcel Perform are dedicated to being a platform for growth for all our team members, regardless of function and location.
The opportunity to work in a fast-growing, super exciting, and innovative business that will revolutionize the e-commerce logistics industry. You will be the needle of success on the growth of a global product that will become a key platform behind successful e-commerce logistics worldwide.
The ability to continuously learn and develop in an international setting with you is critical for our success in achieving our mission.
An environment where everybody never stops growing and focuses on succeeding - we continuously work with you on your strengths and weaknesses across many important dimensions and look at ways for you to address them and further your development
Your entry ticket into being part of the Parcel Perform journey, where you will work with and alongside people from around the world that share the same passion and dedication.
