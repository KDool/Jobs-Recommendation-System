About Sky Mavis

Sky Mavis is a team of nation builders. Together, we build both the virtual worlds of the future and the infrastructure that makes them possible. When it comes to building our internal nation, we put lots of effort into creating a working environment where you will find fulfillment every day and can be yourself just as much as you are when at home. At our cores, we are entrepreneurs, innovators, nerds, and gamers. We are a group of people who are curious about new things, passionate about creating impactful changes, and candid when it comes to challenges and critics.

We are most well known for our flagship game franchise - Axie Infinity. Although it currently primarily consists of a Battle experience, this is just the very beginning and we are looking to improve that experience as well as expand into numerous other game genres. However, just with what we have now our Daily Active Users have grown to over 2.5M and more than $3B of transactions have been made within the ecosystem, making us the largest blockchain gaming project by far.

We are at the forefront of technological innovation and we are moving fast. As part of our team, you’ll join a group of talented young people, who are making changes while having fun doing it.

About the Role
To date, blockchain technology has been boring and mainly focused on trading. Axie is here to change that with fun, dynamic gameplay that allows players to improve and trade assets that they have complete and total ownership over. Axie is also more than a game— it's a gaming platform with infinite possibilities and potential spinoff mini-games so you'll have a lot of freedom to start new initiatives and make them your own. Being a Product Manager at Sky Mavis, you are expected to:

Develop and own the product roadmap in collaboration with the team
Perform project management, communicate and manage timelines cross-functionally
Align the team to a clear vision, so that everyone is moving together in the same direction
Participate in designing, developing and growing our Axie core game production
Set goals and KPIs for the game, and ensure the product is working towards achieving them
Perform research to understand relevant information such as opportunity sizes, target markets, community, and best practices to inform our decisions and how we make games
Distill complex problems and strategies into communications that will be easily applied to day-to-day prioritization and decision-making
Work with other departments (art, engineer, operation) to prototype, and ensure the game production meets its design vision
Make trade-offs across technical, design, product, art, legal, and numerous other areas that the game touches
Manage game economies and ensure they are sustainable
Understand team members strengths and abilities to help drive estimations and work allocation. Help the team grow
Execute. Do what it takes to ship

This role will report to the Game Product Lead.

At our cores, we are entrepreneurs, innovators, nerds, and gamers. We are a group of people who are curious about new things, passionate about creating impactful changes, and candid when it comes to challenges and critics.

We are most well known for our flagship game franchise - Axie Infinity. Although it currently primarily consists of a Battle experience, this is just the very beginning and we are looking to improve that experience as well as expand into numerous other game genres. However, just with what we have now our Daily Active Users have grown to over 2.5M and more than $3B of transactions have been made within the ecosystem, making us the largest blockchain gaming project by far.

We are at the forefront of technological innovation and we are moving fast. As part of our team, you’ll join a group of talented young people, who are making changes while having fun doing it.

To date, blockchain technology has been boring and mainly focused on trading.

Participate in designing, developing and growing our Axie core game production
Set goals and KPIs for the game, and ensure the product is working towards achieving them
Perform research to understand relevant information such as opportunity sizes, target markets, community, and best practices to inform our decisions and how we make games
Distill complex problems and strategies into communications that will be easily applied to day-to-day prioritization and decision-making
Work with other departments (art, engineer, operation) to prototype, and ensure the game production meets its design vision
Make trade-offs across technical, design, product, art, legal, and numerous other areas that the game touches
Manage game economies and ensure they are sustainable
Understand team members strengths and abilities to help drive estimations and work allocation. Help the team grow
Execute. Do what it takes to ship.

This role will report to the Game Product Lead.

Currently, we are looking for a Product Manager to specifically work on our flagship Axie Infinity: Origin battle game. The possibilities and creativity that can go into this ambitious project is truly infinite.

Requirements
Numerous years of professional experiences as a Game Product Manager for games with significant number of daily active users
Experience playing, designing, balancing, producing, shipping, and managing economies for live games
Deep understanding of gaming KPIs across acquisition, activation, retention and monetization
Experience using data to inform decisions, model game systems, create business management models, and predict outcomes

A strong sense of what makes a gameplay experience compelling and fun, as well as the ability to articulate well why a game design decision is good or bad
Strong written and oral communication skills to ensure alignment across cross-functional teams
