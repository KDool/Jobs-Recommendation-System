WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HERE They are made up of a bunch of creatives, entrepreneurs and tech-driven individuals. They’re far from the straightlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-holding and they expect you to pull your own weight like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow, then you’re one of us."

About The CodaPay Team

The Payments Team is committed to expand Coda’s payment methods by integrating with top payment methods available globally and build scalable, secured payments platforms to become the preferred digital content payment service provider, allowing our partners to use our platform to accept payments from their end-users in a simple and effective way.

Responsibilities
Design and develop highly scalable, reliable, secure, and fault-tolerant systems end to end using state of the art technology

We establish partnerships with a wide range of alternative payment channel operators who make it possible for customers to pay in other ways: paying cash at retail, using a mobile wallet, making a bank transfer, or redeeming a prepaid card.

Coda also allows publishers to accept payments through these various methods on their own website or at our gaming e-commerce site - codashop.com.

At Axon, we’re on a mission to Protect Life. We’re explorers, pursuing society’s most critical safety and justice issues with our ecosystem of devices and cloud software.

We are an equal opportunity employer that promotes justice, advances equity, values diversity and fosters inclusion.

Real Time Operations in Public Safety

While enterprise collaboration has experienced a sea of change in the past 10 years (think Zoom, Slack, and a bevy of role and domain specific tools), public safety has largely been left behind. Though police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services personnel put themselves in harm’s way on a daily basis, their ability to communicate and coordinate is hampered by disjointed systems, arcane user interfaces, and technology that was implemented before (and without) modern product design and technology. The news is full of examples of first responders lacking critical information, which leads to less than ideal outcomes.

Axon is in a unique position to address this problem. As the the largest provider of de-escalation training and the creator of the world’s first LTE-connected body camera, we are leading the charge to connect first responders, enable them to make more intelligent decisions, and ultimately save more lives. To that end, the Real Time Ops team is creating a new product category: Axon Respond. Axon Respond integrates sensors, highly important data, and text/voice/video communications into a single platform that enables lightning-fast collaboration. Like all teams at Axon, we value transparency and bias for action, and are looking for talented people from all backgrounds to join us in pulling the future forward into today.

Your Impact

As a Software Engineer on the Real Time Operations team, you involve in multiple activities to extend our product capabilities as well as solidify it for new customers. You also take the lead in our new initiatives that leverage technologies to make safer life for millions of people around the world.

What You'll Do

Own end to end features and improvements from design to production, from frontend to backend
Set a high technical bar for the team through code and architecture design reviews
An owner of meaningful parts of our service, having an impact and growing with the company
Working across teams with Product, Design, and Engineering to create an integrated solution
Following the latest in software engineering and open source technologies, and being capable of intuit the fine line between promising new practice and overhyped fad.

What You Bring

6+ years of professional software development experience
Experience in design, deliver and operate highly-available, scalable cloud-based systems
Backend service experience in multiple, managed languages such as Java, Scala, Go, or similar
Ability to work autonomous and collaborate with other team members

Preferred Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in CS, engineering, or other quantitative fields
Good computer science backgrounds (programming, data structure, algorithm)
Significant experience, apply best practices in design and implement APIs
Experience working with Microservice, Kubernetes, Kafka, SQL or NoSQL data stores is a strong plus
Frontend experience in Typescript, or similar, prefer modern frameworks like React, Angular, Vue

Benefits That Benefit You

Medical and Dental Insurance

About Our Software Team

At Synacy, we develop our own products. Our founders, product teams, engineering teams, and customer support teams are all part of the same company, co-located in our offices (mainly in Cebu and Manila) and work closely together to develop products that delight our customers.

Our software team is composed of 3 to 5 cross-functional members and is designed to be complete and responsible for delivering complete features to users. We expect our engineers to be not just writing code, but to participate in the entire process from investigating problems, designing solutions, and implementing them into features our users will love. In addition, we have a leadership team that is composed of team leads, product managers, and engineering managers, that work together in leading the entire software group.

We use a goal-oriented product roadmap to keep all our teams aligned, which is updated in a weekly cycle by the leadership team. Further, we maintain a corresponding release plan based on a monthly release cycle, where we break down features into sizeable chunks that our teams can work with as little inter-team dependency as possible.

Our teams apply an agile process of weekly planning, retrospectives, daily check-in, pair programming, and use Trello to visualize our progress. All our code is version controlled in Github and all code changes go through a peer-review process.

We have a continuous delivery pipeline, using CircleCI and CloudFormation, and perform deployment using automated tools in our AWS production site. We built most of our automation tools and we expect all our engineers to participate in maintaining our development tools, delivery pipelines, and production sites.

Our teams are encouraged to spend time developing their knowledge and skills so they stay relevant in their field. We have self-initiated learning sessions and allocate time in weekly sprints for learning activities.

About Our Distributed Team

We have distributed teams as part of our software group wherein all members of the team work remotely. Though it is an option for distributed team members to work in one of our offices in Cebu or Manila, it is expected of everyone to effectively participate in a distributed or remote-first environment.

Teams work full-time in a remote working environment wherein members are not expected to be in the same physical space. However, there are a few scheduled in-person get-togethers to strengthen the team’s relationship. Work schedule is flexible with an overlap of 4 hours a day of working together. Communication and documentation are primarily done using online channels.

Our leadership team works in a distributed environment and operates primarily using online channels. Though some of our feature teams are on-site in our offices, we have made adjustments so that both distributed and on-site teams can effectively work together. Work structure is the same for both distributed and on-site teams and follow the same principles and frameworks we defined in our engineering culture.

Every member of a distributed team is responsible for creating the working conditions to effectively participate in a distributed environment. Similar to how our company is obliged to create good working conditions in our office space, every distributed team member is obliged to create a similar space wherever he/she chooses to work.

The company will provide the primary equipment for working at the same level as teams working on-site in an office, either at full cost or subsidized in accordance to the general policy of our company. Other than this, every member of the team is expected to establish the space, equipment, and infrastructure for their own use to achieve their ideal working conditions.

We do not offer training for anyone to be qualified for distributed work and expect members to independently prepare and be ready to be part of a distributed team.

About The Company

Synacy is a global company developing software products in the Philippines using international best practices and delivering them to our customers around the world. We aim to help businesses be competitive in a consolidating telecommunications and technology market and give them access to opportunities that until now only large companies can realize.

We believe the best results for end users and customers come from having a number of various companies providing the best to service them. We want to enable them to thrive by providing the infrastructure and tools for them to sell new telecom products and enhance the value they deliver to their customers.

Though we are based in the Philippines, our founders are originally from Australia and we have a diverse and multinational leadership team, bringing in perspectives from different backgrounds and cultures. We continuously learn from each other to become better at what we do.

Our company offers our products under a few brands. At UTBox, Monopond, and BurstFax, we offer fax and SMS messaging products available globally for retail and wholesale use. We also founded an internet service provider to accelerate the internet in the Philippines called RISE. At RISE, we offer competitive fiber-based internet access to businesses located in major cities in the country.

It is our intent to form a globally competitive organization. We believe talented and remarkable people are found anywhere in the world. At the moment, we have most of our teams co-located in our offices in the Philippines. However, we don’t limit our reach here and are forming a remote-first culture within our organization so we can offer the opportunity to current and new members to work wherever they are productive.

A Few Of Our Strategies
Software and automation is at our core. We believe in efficient, resilient, and scalable approach. Work smarter not harder, so that when you work hard you are working smart.
To our customers, we want to offer a complete service in an integrated package.
We have taken the challenge of integrating with many telecommunication providers in the world and aggregated our customer traffic to offer a consistent quality at the best possible price."

About Agoda

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 2.5 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 4,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

Get to Know Our Team

In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.

The Opportunity

We’d love to hear from you if you are skilled in any of the technologies we work with (note – we are not looking for you to have them all). We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from individuals just starting their IT careers to experts in their field, although this particular position is better suitable to veteran engineers, with expertise in certain technologies, and especially those that had lead projects, initiatives and/or teams.

In This Role, You’ll Get to

Think and own the full life cycle of our products, not just a single piece of code – from business requirements, technology selection, coding standards, agile development, unit and application testing, to CI/CD and proper monitoring
Design, develop and maintain platforms across the back end area
Improve scalability, stability, and efficiency of our existing systems
Write great code and help others write great code
Collaborate with other teams and departments

What You’ll Need To Succeed

5+ years’ experience under your belt developing performance-critical applications that run in a production environment using Scala, Java or C#
Experience in leading projects, initiatives and/or teams, with full ownership of the systems involved
Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
Strong coding ability
You are passionate about the craft of software development and constantly work to improve your knowledge and skills
Excellent verbal and written English communication skills

It’s Great If You Have

Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies
Experience building large-scale distributed products
Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment
Hands-on experience working with technology like queueing systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, MSMQ), Spark, Hadoop, NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB), Play framework, Akka library

We establish partnerships with a wide range of alternative payment channel operators who make it possible for customers to pay in other ways: paying cash at retail, using a mobile wallet, making a bank transfer, or redeeming a prepaid card.

Coda also allows publishers to accept payments through these various methods on their own website or at our gaming e-commerce site - codashop.com.

At Coda, we operate a high volume payments and e-commerce business, and we’re expanding rapidly. We need to build high-scale, distributed systems that can gracefully handle massive spikes in traffic.

We work remotely from over 20 countries across the globe. We have development offices in key locations throughout Asia as well, in case you prefer working from an office. We hire top engineers, and give them the flexibility to work productively as part of a distributed team!

About The CodaPay Team

What we do

Currently operating in 40+ countries and processing up to 7 million transactions a day, Coda Payments (https://www.codapayments.com/) helps game developers and publishers like Riot Games, Tencent, Garena, EA, Moonton, and other leading digital content providers to monetize their products in places where credit and debit cards aren’t widely used. We establish partnerships with a wide range of alternative payment channel operators who make it possible for customers to pay in other ways: paying cash at retail, using a mobile wallet, making a bank transfer, or redeeming a prepaid card.

Coda also allows publishers to accept payments through these various methods on their own website or at our gaming e-commerce site - codashop.com.

About Coda Technology

At Coda, we operate a high volume payments and e-commerce business, and we’re expanding rapidly. We need to build high-scale, distributed systems that can gracefully handle massive spikes in traffic. We also have an ambitious feature roadmap, so using state of the art tools to automate our development lifecycle is crucial to moving fast. We believe in autonomous teams, and we use modern technologies and the latest in cloud infrastructure.

Most importantly, we hire great people and empower them to drive Coda’s technology and products forward. We believe that the best ideas can come from everyone, so we encourage taking ownership and maintain a culture of servant leadership that allows engineers to drive features.

Working at Coda

Life at Coda is fast-paced, challenging, and fun. As a rapidly growing global company, we’re always looking to step up and adapt to changes quickly; there is never a dull day at Coda.

We make things happen in the most impactful and effective manner. If you are always eager to initiate new ideas, hungry to contribute more, derive satisfaction from team wins rather than individual ones, and value integrity, you will fit perfectly into the Coda team!

About The Role

We are looking for a proactive, driven engineer who is hungry to contribute using their deep and fundamental knowledge in software development and automation. You will be responsible for the architecture, development, and evolution of key products and features at Coda.

We work remotely from over 20 countries across the globe. We have development offices in key locations throughout Asia as well, in case you prefer working from an office. We hire top engineers, and give them the flexibility to work productively as part of a distributed team!

About The XShop Team

Our vision is to be the clearinghouse for digital top-ups. xShop’s current mission is to provide Coda and its partners an asymmetric edge by building a highly versatile B2B platform for the gaming industry. We help Publishers extend their reach and Distributors get access to digital content. We are looking for trailblazers who are composed enough in a crisis yet courageous enough to put their hands on the plough to push the team forward.

Responsibilities
Design and develop highly scalable, reliable, secure, and fault-tolerant systems end to end using state of the art technology
Work directly with Product and Technology team members to define and implement complex features
Collaborate with other team members to learn and share best practices
Understand and constantly optimize our products, identifying and fixing problems, improving stability and user experience
Take operational responsibility for the services that are owned by your team
Debug production issues across services
Participate in on-call rotations as needed (we support a healthy work/life balance, so we invest in minimizing out-of-office interruptions and we use rotations to minimize on-call days)

Requirements
5 years of experience in software development
A bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or a related field (or equivalent experience)
Strong knowledge of one or more programming languages (Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, Go, C/C++, Rust, Python, C#, etc.) and the ability to learn new programming languages quickly
Strong understanding of software architecture
Understanding of data systems and how to query/interact with them (RDBMS, NoSQL, Queues, etc.)
A desire to build automation into everything you do, including implementing state of the art CI/CD practices and test automation
Understanding of agile methodologies (e.g. Scrum)
Good command of the English language and the ability to communicate effectively

Bonus if you have
Experience building high scale APIs
Knowledge of AWS and cloud technologies such as lambdas and containerization
Experience in FinTech or related fields requiring strong security discipline

We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate based on gender, race, age, religion, disability, or other local protected class. We are committed to cultivating an inclusive environment for all employees, and we welcome the diversity that you will bring!
