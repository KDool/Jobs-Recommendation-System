They’re far from the straightlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies, at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID19, and in a matter of 6 months, they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman, FM91.3, Vulcan Post, e27, etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-holding and they expect you to pull your own weight like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company, as co-workers, and as individuals. Therefore, they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate, willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do, because they do too.

Though police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services personnel put themselves in harm’s way on a daily basis, their ability to communicate and coordinate is hampered by disjointed systems, arcane user interfaces, and technology that was implemented before (and without) modern product design and technology. The news is full of examples of first responders lacking critical information, which leads to less than ideal outcomes.\n\nAxon is in a unique position to address this problem. As the the largest provider of de-escalation training and the creator of the world’s first LTE-connected body camera, we are leading the charge to connect first responders, enable them to make more intelligent decisions, and ultimately save more lives.

Our founders, product teams, engineering teams, and customer support teams are all part of the same company, co-located in our offices (mainly in Cebu and Manila) and work closely together to develop products that delight our customers.\n\nOur software team is composed of 3 to 5 cross-functional members and is designed to be complete and responsible for delivering complete features to users. We expect our engineers to be not just writing code, but to participate in the entire process from investigating problems, designing solutions, and implementing them into features our users will love. In addition, we have a leadership team that is composed of team leads, product managers, and engineering managers, that work together in leading the entire software group.\n\nWe use a goal-oriented product roadmap to keep all our teams aligned, which is updated in a weekly cycle by the leadership team. Further, we maintain a corresponding release plan based on a monthly release cycle, where we break down features into sizeable chunks that our teams can work with as little inter-team dependency as possible.\n\nOur teams apply an agile process of weekly planning, retrospectives, daily check-in, pair programming, and use Trello to visualize our progress. All our code is version controlled in Github and all code changes go through a peer-review process.\n\nWe have a continuous delivery pipeline, using CircleCI and CloudFormation, and perform deployment using automated tools in our AWS production site. We built most of our automation tools and we expect all our engineers to participate in maintaining our development tools, delivery pipelines, and production sites.\n\nOur teams are encouraged to spend time developing their knowledge and skills so they stay relevant in their field. We have self-initiated learning sessions and allocate time in weekly sprints for learning activities.\n\nAbout Our Distributed Team\n\nWe have distributed teams as part of our software group wherein all members of the team work remotely. Though it is an option for distributed team members to work in one of our offices in Cebu or Manila, it is expected of everyone to effectively participate in a distributed or remote-first environment.\n\nTeams work full-time in a remote working environment wherein members are not expected to be in the same physical space. However, there are a few scheduled in-person get-togethers to strengthen the team’s relationship. Work schedule is flexible with an overlap of 4 hours a day of working together. Communication and documentation are primarily done using online channels.\n\nOur leadership team works in a distributed environment and operates primarily using online channels. Though some of our feature teams are on-site in our offices, we have made adjustments so that both distributed and on-site teams can effectively work together. Work structure is the same for both distributed and on-site teams and follow the same principles and frameworks we defined in our engineering culture.\n\nEvery member of a distributed team is responsible for creating the working conditions to effectively participate in a distributed environment. Similar to how our company is obliged to create good working conditions in our office space, every distributed team member is obliged to create a similar space wherever he/she chooses to work.\n\nThe company will provide the primary equipment for working at the same level as teams working on-site in an office, either at full cost or subsidized in accordance to the general policy of our company. Other than this, every member of the team is expected to establish the space, equipment, and infrastructure for their own use to achieve their ideal working conditions.\n\nWe do not offer training for anyone to be qualified for distributed work and expect members to independently prepare and be ready to be part of a distributed team.\n\nAbout The Company\n\nSynacy is a global company developing software products in the Philippines using international best practices and delivering them to our customers around the world. We aim to help businesses be competitive in a consolidating telecommunications and technology market and give them access to opportunities that until now only large companies can realize.\n\nWe believe the best results for end users and customers come from having a number of various companies providing the best to service them. We want to enable them to thrive by providing the infrastructure and tools for them to sell new telecom products and enhance the value they deliver to their customers.\n\nThough we are based in the Philippines, our founders are originally from Australia and we have a diverse and multinational leadership team, bringing in perspectives from different backgrounds and cultures. We continuously learn from each other to become better at what we do.\n\nOur company offers our products under a few brands. At UTBox, Monopond, and BurstFax, we offer fax and SMS messaging products available globally for retail and wholesale use. We also founded an internet service provider to accelerate the internet in the Philippines called RISE. At RISE, we offer competitive fiber-based internet access to businesses located in major cities in the country.\n\nIt is our intent to form a globally competitive organization. We believe talented and remarkable people are found anywhere in the world. At the moment, we have most of our teams co-located in our offices in the Philippines. However, we don’t limit our reach here and are forming a remote-first culture within our organization so we can offer the opportunity to current and new members to work wherever they are productive.\n\nA Few Of Our Strategies\nSoftware and automation is at our core. We believe in efficient, resilient, and scalable approach. Work smarter not harder, so that when you work hard you are working smart.\nTo our customers, we want to offer a complete service in an integrated package.\nWe have taken the challenge of integrating with many telecommunication providers in the world and aggregated our customer traffic to offer a consistent quality at the best possible price.'}
