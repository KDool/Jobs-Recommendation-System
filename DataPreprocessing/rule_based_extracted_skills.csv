WHY YOU‘LL LOVE WORKING HEREThey are made up of a bunch of creatives  entrepreneurs and tech-driven individuals. They’re far from the straightlaced corporates that you might imagine pulling the strings behind healthcare companies. They represent a new breed of healthcare companies  at the forefront of revolutionizing how people receive medical treatment. They were founded in the midst of COVID19  and in a matter of 6 months  they've grown to thousands of patients and hit over 7 figures in Annual Run Rate. They have also been featured on Augustman  FM91.3  Vulcan Post  e27  etc. They see themselves continuing to grow to all new heights and therefore are looking for someone with the skills to help us meet the technological demands that come with it. You will be joining a young startup in a growth phase and you will also be working remotely (they don't intend to get an office anytime soon). This means a couple of things: Flexible schedule. You will have a more flexible schedule but you will also have to be prepared to fight fires at odd hours when you least expect. Pull your own weight.There'll be no hand-holding and they expect you to pull your own weight like everyone else. Things get messy. There's no sugarcoating this. Things are unstructured and processes might be lacking. They're not where they want to be but they're getting there. You must be able to thrive in ambiguous situations (see point above). You are willing to put in the time to get the most out of any opportunity. Building a strong team is key in our ambition to thrive as a company  as co-workers  and as individuals. Therefore  they are looking for someone similarly dedicated and passionate  willing to put their best foot forward (go all stakes in) and take pride in what they do  because they do too. If you are interested in joining us at this point in our journey and are someone who enjoys sticking their hands in the dirt and putting in the work to see something grow  then you’re one of us.,en,[]
